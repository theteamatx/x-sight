  Perform a Multiplication operation on two integers using the Sight backend system.

  This function proposes a calculation action (with inputs `a`, `b`) to the server via a Sight worker.
  It waits for the worker to process the action and return the computed result.

  Args:
      a (int): The first integer operand.
      b (int): The second integer operand.
  Returns:
      str: The result of the calculation as a string.

  Example:
      >>> multiplication_api_with_sight(5, 3)
      "15"
