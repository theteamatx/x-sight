  summary: |-
    Processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them to a
    subscriber.
  overview: |-
    The Eventarc Publishing API allows services to define and raise events
    which are routed based on the filtering configured through an Eventarc
    Standard trigger or Eventarc Advanced enrollment. The code that raises
    these events can run on Google Cloud compute platforms or in other cloud
    environments. Eventarc acts as an intermediary between producers and
    consumers of these events, asynchronously delivering events, and
    supporting the orchestration of these decoupled services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
